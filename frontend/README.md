# NodeJS & React Dev. - TDs - Ilan Zini (DIA6)


## Frontend Overview: 

This project is an Angular application designed to interact with the backend API. 
It uses Angular's components, routing, and data binding to create a dynamic, responsive web application. 
Bootstrap is integrated for styling.


## Quick Start:

1. Install Angular CLI globally if not already installed:
    `npm install -g @angular/cli`


2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies: 
    `npm install`


3. Start the Angular development server:
    `ng serve`


4. Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:4200.


## Notes:

- Use `src/proxy.conf.json` for HTTP requests to proxy the backend at http://localhost:3000.

- Check `src/app` for components like lesson-edit-form or todo-list-page for different functionalities.
